# Data Structure - Stacks
-Vending Machine Stack Problem

-Stacks are another data structure that are easy to learn and useful for controlling memory.

-Stacks opperate off of FIFO

>"In computing and in systems theory, FIFO an acronym for first in, first out (the first in is the first out) is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first."

Think of a stack of pancakes. If you want to get to the bottom pancake, you need to first remove the cakes on top.

# Data Structure - Sets
-Sets are very similar to a list, however, they are different because of a certain unique property.
>"Because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections."

Birth Country Statistics problem:

In this problem you will be using a set to find duplicates, delete them, and correct any upper or lower case errors.

# Data Structure - Trees
Trees are one of the most powerful data structures in programming.

>"Trees are so useful and frequently used, because they have some very serious advantages:

>Trees reflect structural relationships in the data.

>Trees are used to represent hierarchies.

>Trees provide an efficient insertion and searching.

>Trees are very flexible data, allowing to move subtrees around with minumum effort."
